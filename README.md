### take.note is a Project-based note organizer web app with multiple User accounts. 

An MVC-structured responsive web app, take.note utilizes a MySQL database accessed with the Sequelize ORM, Handlebars for data-based page templating, and Bootstrap front-end elements modified with custom CSS. The web-based Quill.js word processor allows the main document of each Project various formatting options.

The database has four tables created and managed by Sequelize ORM models: Users, Projects, Topics, and Resources, which are all associated with a cascading one-to-many relationship, in that order. 

Each table has a name column, with the name value of Projects, Topics, and Resources being editable from the User interface with input area on-focus/on-blur event handlers; no "submit" button clicks needed.

Each Project also contains the main Project's word-processor formattable document, and each Resource contains a Resource Content text field for storage of individual notes. The Project and Resouce Content fields are also editable by the same on-focus/on-blur events as their titles, again eliminating the need for "submit" buttons.

Also included is the ability to delete Projects, Topics, and Resources. In addition, there are buttons on the right sides that allow the toggling of expand/collapse of either all Resource Contents, just the Resource Contents of a single Topic, and of individual Resource Content areas for easier viewing of current items being worked on.

Basic User login is handled by storing the User's name in the browser's local storage, and matching that value to the UserName field in the Users table in the databse. This takes the User to a page listing all of the User's Projects. If the Username entered does not already exist in the database, the app creates a new User and associates the User name to it's own Projects.
